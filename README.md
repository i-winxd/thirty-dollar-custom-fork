# DON'T YOU LECTURE ME WITH YOUR THIRTY DOLLAR CUSTOM SOUNDS FORK
## About
A Chrome extension that allows you to add custom sounds to GDColon's [Thirty Dollar Website](https://thirtydollar.website/)

This **fork** allows you to create your custom sounds using this repository: https://github.com/i-winxd/thirty-dollar-custom-sounds-maker and load it into the thirty dollar website. Please read that repository, because it contains all the information you need, and how to generate the files needed to work with this extension. You may want to check out the existing project where I forked this from.

**SECURITY WARNING:** Be very careful about loading JSONs from other people!! The [other repository](https://github.com/i-winxd/thirty-dollar-custom-sounds-maker) should tell you the right way of sharing custom sounds.

## Usage
 - Clone this repository by downloading it.
